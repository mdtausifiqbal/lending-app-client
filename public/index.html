<!-- In this file, we have a div with an id of root, which is where the React application will be rendered.

We also have a script tag that links to src/index.js, which is the entry point for our React application.

The link tag is used to include the Tailwind CSS framework, as per your specification. You can replace this with any other CSS framework or custom stylesheets as needed.

The meta tag for viewport is added for responsive design, which ensures that the application will scale correctly on different screen sizes.

The title tag sets the title of the page, which is displayed in the browser tab. You should replace "Lending App" with the actual title of your application. -->
