Sure, here is a simple Dashboard component using React hooks and function-based components:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const Dashboard = () => {
  const [owedAmount, setOwedAmount] = useState(0);
  const [sendAmount, setSendAmount] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    // Mock fetch owed amount from API
    const fetchOwedAmount = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('/api/owed-amount'); // replace with real API endpoint
      const data = await response.json();
      setOwedAmount(data.amount);
    };

    fetchOwedAmount();
  }, []);

  const handleSendAmountChange = (event) => {
    setSendAmount(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleSendAmountSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    // Mock send amount to API
    const response = await fetch('/api/send-amount', { // replace with real API endpoint
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ amount: sendAmount }),
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      setOwedAmount(owedAmount - sendAmount);
      setSendAmount('');
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Dashboard</h1>
      <p className="mb-4">Amount owed: ${owedAmount}</p>
      <form onSubmit={handleSendAmountSubmit}>
        <input
          type="number"
          value={sendAmount}
          onChange={handleSendAmountChange}
          className="border p-2 mr-2"
          min="0"
          step="0.01"
        />
        <button type="submit" className="py-2 px-4 bg-blue-500 text-white">
          Send
        </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Dashboard;
```

In this example, we use React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage state and side effects in our function component. We also simulate fetching the owed amount from an API with `fetch` and use controlled components to handle form inputs and submission.

Please note that in a real-world scenario, you would replace the `/api/owed-amount` and `/api/send-amount` endpoints with the actual endpoints in your application's backend API.

The style classes used are from Tailwind CSS. You can adjust them to fit your design requirements.
