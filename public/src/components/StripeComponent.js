/*
In order to integrate Stripe into a React application, you'll first need to install Stripe's JavaScript library, @stripe/react-stripe-js and @stripe/stripe-js, into your project. This library provides a set of React components to make it easier to build checkout experiences.

Here's a simple StripeComponent that collects card details and handles form submission:
*/
import React from 'react';
import { CardElement, useStripe, useElements } from '@stripe/react-stripe-js';

const StripeComponent = () => {
  const stripe = useStripe();
  const elements = useElements();

  const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    if (!stripe || !elements) {
      // Stripe.js has not yet loaded.
      // Make sure to disable form submission until Stripe.js has loaded.
      return;
    }

    const cardElement = elements.getElement(CardElement);

    const {error, paymentMethod} = await stripe.createPaymentMethod({
      type: 'card',
      card: cardElement,
    });

    if (error) {
      console.log('[error]', error);
    } else {
      console.log('[PaymentMethod]', paymentMethod);
      // Here you can send the paymentMethod.id to your server to charge the card
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <CardElement />
      <button type="submit" disabled={!stripe}>
        Pay
      </button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default StripeComponent;

/*
This code provides a form for users to enter their card details and a function to handle form submission. The function stripe.createPaymentMethod sends the card details to Stripe's servers, which return a PaymentMethod object that you can use to charge the card. Note that to run this code, you'll need to set up a Stripe context at a higher level in your application, typically in the root component, using the Elements provider from @stripe/react-stripe-js.

Please note that you need to handle server-side operations in a real-world scenario. The server-side operations include confirming the payment and handling any errors that may occur. The client-side code only collects card details and sends them to Stripe's servers. The actual charging of the card is performed server-side.
